What is cynergy:
Collaborate: "Peers and environment are among the crucial components of growth. Thus, we encourage students to collaborate and group together to create the required habitat for programmers."
Innovation: "Innovation distinguishes between a leader and a follower. Cynergy encourages students to come up with innovative ideas, and provides support for bringing those ideas into fruition."
Compete: "No Competition, No Progress. Competing with peers sharpens ones skills, and  provides a feeling of exhilaration like no other. So let loose and conquer the leaderboard!"
Open: "In accordance with GNU's philosophy, we aim to be open and free. Progress does not occur when one monopolizes knowledge and discoveries. Collaborating with a vast community not only improves one's understanding, it also protects one's privacy and enables transparency, both of which are our priorities."
